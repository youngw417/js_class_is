Count Instances of a Character in a String
Create a function that takes two strings as arguments and 
returns the number of times the first string 
(the single character) is found in the second string.

Examples
charCount("a", "edabit") ➞ 1

charCount("c", "Chamber of secrets") ➞ 1

charCount("b", "big fat bubble") ➞ 4


function charCount(s1, s2) {
    let counter = 0


    return counter
}
